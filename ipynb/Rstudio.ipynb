    "# R and RStudio\n",
    "\n",
    "R is a free and open source statistical programming language. The main advantage of using R is its large community and many statistical packages. R packages are collections of functions which can greatly simplify analyses. Almost any statistical analysis you can think of will be in an R package, which also makes R optimal for amplicon data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "RStudio is a great interface for running R, and gives a good overview of both your script, environment, console, plots, and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install (not needed when running analyses through ERDA)\n",
    "* [First install R](https://www.r-project.org/)\n",
    "* [Then install RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting help with R\n",
    "Search your problem or question on your favorite search engine and you will usually find multiple websites with the answer. Stack Overflow and R-bloggers, just to name a few examples, are great places to find help. Running ?nameOfFunction in R will guide you to the help page of the function. Most packages have a vignette, in which you can find detailed information on how to use the package.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rstudio overview\n",
    "In the image below the red text describes what the different sections in R-studio contains. A more detailed overview can be found in this [blog](https://www.r-bloggers.com/a-tour-of-rstudio/)\n",
